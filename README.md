The overall changes i made :
I have done styling on all 3 screens which are the SignIn Screen, Home Screen, Menu Screen 
The SignIn Screen is to  authenticate users by verifying their identity before granting access to secure features or data within an application or system. When users enter their credentials (such as a username or email and password), the system checks if these match the records in its database.
The Home Screen the user will have options to choose the food item of their choosing and it shows them the price.
The menu screen the user will see the name of which show them what food items they have 

In the Home page I put an option to show specials for the days of the week and it shows specials for the current day and it shows the previous days specials
